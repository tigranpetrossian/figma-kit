# Value Field
####  Resilient input for controlling various properties
<br/>

## Overview

The Value Field, despite its simple appearance, is one of the most complex components in Figma.
In many ways, it was the main reason this library was conceived in the first place.

The component allows users to adjust various properties of different elements such as color,
width, height, angle, font size, and more. It is designed to be extremely resilient to incorrect input.

## Building blocks
The Value Field doesn't ship as a set of ready-made components as they appear in Figma. Instead,
it provides the necessary primitives to create the variations needed for your plugin. The
following sections describe these primitives in detail.


## Numeric

Basic numeric input. Most value fields (opacity, color channels, width, height) can be built
using this input in combination with other elements from ValueField.

Similar to Figma's property fields, and unlike regular form input, Numeric field commits the
value by calling `onChange` on <kbd>Enter</kbd> or `blur`, and reverts on `Escape`.

Numeric input is a controlled component, meaning `value` and `onChange` props are required for
it to function.

<ArgTypes of={ValueFieldStories.Numeric} />

## Icons and labels

Use a combination of `Root` and `Label` to create value fields with icons or labels

### With label
<Canvas layout="centered" of={ValueFieldStories.WithLabel}/>

### With icon
<Canvas layout="centered" of={ValueFieldStories.WithIcon}/>


## Multi-value inputs

Creates multi-value inputs by using `Multi` wrapper. The following example replicates Figma's
RGBA input by using 4 numeric inputs in a `Multi`.
<Canvas layout="centered" of={ValueFieldStories.MultiInput}/>

Notice the usage of `targetRange`, `min`, and `max` props in the code above. Figma natively stores
colors in `RGBA` format with channel values normalized to 0-1 range. Using `targetRange`
of 0-255 native values are converted to the correct display range internally.

## Hex

This component replicates the hex input functionality in Figma. It accepts user input and
adjusts to the nearest valid hex value. Values Users can increment and decrement values using the
keyboard, either for the entire input or individual color channels.

The hex input can be used  can be used in conjunction with numeric input to create a primary
color input similar to the one in Figma.
