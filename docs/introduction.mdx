## Overview

Figma Kit is an extensive set of React components for building Figma plugins that look and
behave like Figma's interface.

### Features

- UI3 Ready: Components are designed to match Figma's new interface.
- Automatic dark mode: Dark mode is supported out of the box without any setup or additional code,
thanks to Figma's semantic color tokens.
- Incremental Adoption: Components can be gradually integrated into existing plugins.
