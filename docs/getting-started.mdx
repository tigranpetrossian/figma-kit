## Quick start

<br />

### Install Figma Kit

```
npm install figma-kit@beta
```

### Enable access to Figma's semantic tokens in your plugin UI setup:

Figma injects a set of [semantic color tokens as CSS custom properties](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/css-variables/) into plugin UI. Figma Kit
relies on those to display the components correctly. Enable this by initializing your plugin UI
as shown below:

<Source code="figma.showUI(__html__, { themeColors: true, /* other options */ })" />

### Import Figma Kit styles into your CSS

<Source code="@import 'figma-kit/styles.css'" />

Alternatively, if your plugin does not use CSS files, you can also import `styles.css` directly
into your root JavaScript/TypeScript file:

<Source code="import 'figma-kit/styles.css'" />

Importing CSS files into JS/TS might require additional setup, but it is typically already
supported by build tools like Vite.

### Accessing Figma's semantic tokens outside of plugin environment

When using the library outside of Figma plugin UI, e.g. in a normal browser, you'll still need
access to semantic tokens for components to display correctly. Just for that purpose, Figma kit
exports an optional theme file:

<Source code="@import 'figma-kit/figma-development-theme.css'" />

This file is meant to be used for development purposes only, and **should not be included** in
actual plugin code.

### Importing and using components

<Source
  code={`
import { Text } from 'figma-kit'

const App = () => {
  return <Text>Hello Figma</Text>
}
`}
/>
