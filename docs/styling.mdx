## Styling

Figma Kit is designed to closely resemble Figma's interface, so minimal styling is needed,
mainly for layout adjustments. All Figma Kit components accept the className prop and can be styled
using any preferred styling solution.
Figma injects an extensive set of [semantic tokens](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/css-variables/),
which this library relies on, so familiarity with these tokens is recommended.


## Using with Tailwind

Figma kit ships with a Tailwind preset that makes Figma theme tokens available in Tailwind classes:



```tsx
import figmaKitPreset from 'figma-kit/tailwind.preset.js';

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  // ...
  presets: [figmaKitPreset],
};
```


This replaces the default Tailwind theme with Figma tokens, allowing you to use these tokens directly:


```tsx
import { Text } from 'figma-kit'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className"border border-secondary">
      <Text color="text-secondary">Welcome to Figma</Text>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The preset is built to match Figma's [semantic token format](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/css-variables/#tokens-overview),
which is slightly different from how Tailwind themes are typically defined. Here, properties are
strictly mapped to their respective tokens, meaning `bg` tokens will only be available for
backgrounds by default, and cannot be used with for other properties.

```tsx
<div className="text"/>
<div className="text-secondary"/>
<div className="bg"/>
<div className="bg-secondary"/>

```

Translates to:
```css
.text {
  color: var(--figma-color-text);
}
.text-secondary {
  color: var(--figma-color-text-secondary);
}
.bg {
  background-color: var(--figma-color-bg);
}
.bg-secondary {
  background-color: var(--figma-color-bg-secondary);
}
```

### Breaking out of strict property mapping

In rare cases it might be necessary to reference a token for a different property. This can be
done by referencing the custom property directly using Tailwind arbitrary value syntax:

```tsx
<div className="border-[var(--figma-color-bg-brand)]"/>
```

Naturally, this is an escape hatch meant to be used in extreme edge cases. Figma's color system
is very well-designed and rarely requires referencing an irrelevant token.
